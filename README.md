# Trading-Bots-and-Algos

My First Trading Bot was a Cardano ADA RSI bot that followed simple orders to buy and sell cardano when RSI was over/under 70/30 respectively


The next Bot I'm building is an ETC bot that takes into consideration the Stochastic indicator (whether it is overbought or oversold) and the rate of change of the RSI indicator to determine the best time to enter/exit a trade!  This bot ('New_Algo') is still under construction!
